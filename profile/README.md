### Official Account and Source of Code Samples 

Welcome!
------

This collection of code examples is a useful starting point for working with the devices in Thorlabs' product line, as well as implementing the devices in common applications. These code repositories are organized into several categories, according to device type and application:

* Cameras and Imaging Devices
* Light Control and Manipulation Devices
  * e.g. [Polarization Controllers](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=12896) and [Liquid Crystal Devices](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=8983)    
* Lasers and Other Light Source
* Motion Control Products.
  * e.g. [Motor- and Piezo-Based Controllers](https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm?guide_id=2060)
* Current and Temperature Control and Monitoring
* Light Analysis Devices
  * e.g. [Beam Profilers](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=3483), [Wavefront Sensors](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_ID=5287), and [Power Meters](https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm?guide_ID=37) 


Each repository includes individual folders for different programming languages, as well as a list of the products compatible with each code example. To help you get the code running on your machine, there is a README at each level of the repositories providing information about the contents, as well as setup instructions.
