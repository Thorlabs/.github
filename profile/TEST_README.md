This collection of code examples is a useful starting point for working with the devices in Thorlabs' product offering, as well as implementing the devices in common applications. These code repositories are organized into several categories, according to device type and application:

* Cameras and Imaging Devices such as the [Compact Scientific Cameras](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=13243) and [Line Sensor Cameras](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LC100&pn=LC100)
* Light Control and Manipulation Devices such as [Polarization Controllers](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=12896) and [Liquid Crystal Devices](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=8983)    
* Lasers and Other Light Sources such as the [K-Cube Light Source](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2922) and the [4-Channel Fiber-Coupled Laser source](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=3800)
* Motion Control Products including [Motor- and Piezo-Based Controllers](https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm?guide_id=2060)
* Current and Temperature Control and Monitoring such as the [Benchtop Current Controllers](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_ID=4053&pn=LDC4005) and [Multichannel Temperature Monitors](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=14285&pn=UPTEMP)
* Light Analysis Devices including [Beam Profilers](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=3483), [Wavefront Sensors](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_ID=5287), and [Power Meters](https://www.thorlabs.com/navigation.cfm?guide_ID=37) 


Each repository includes individual folders for different programming languages, as well as a list of the products compatible with each code example. To help you get the code running on your machine, there is a README at each level of the repositories providing information about the contents, as well as setup instructions.
